# ParticipantsTable Component - Refactored Architecture

## Overview
The ParticipantsTable component has been completely refactored to implement proper Separation of Concerns (SoC), improve performance, and enhance maintainability. The original 1839-line monolithic component has been broken down into focused, reusable modules.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **`index.js`** - Main entry point (backward compatibility wrapper)
- **`ParticipantsTable.js`** - Main component orchestrating all functionality
- **`components/ReactTable.js`** - Optimized table component with drag-drop and inline editing
- **`components/ColumnCell.js`** - Actions column for edit/delete operations
- **`components/ToolAccessCell.js`** - Tool access management component

### Custom Hooks
- **`hooks/useParticipantsData.js`** - Data fetching, CSV import, refresh logic
- **`hooks/useParticipantsCRUD.js`** - All CRUD operations with comprehensive error handling
- **`hooks/useTableState.js`** - UI state management for dialogs and selections

### Configuration
- **`config/tableColumns.js`** - Table column definitions and configurations

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Component Memoization
- `React.memo` applied to main components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Proper `displayName` set for debugging

### 2. Callback Optimization
- `useCallback` for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Memoized data transformations with `useMemo`

### 3. State Management
- Separated concerns into focused custom hooks
- Reduced prop drilling through strategic state placement
- Optimized Redux selectors

### 4. Code Splitting
- Large component broken into smaller, focused modules
- Reusable components extracted for better tree-shaking

## Key Features Maintained

### ✅ All Original Functionality Preserved
- Participant CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- CSV import with enhanced error handling
- Inline editing with real-time validation
- Tool access management
- Email credential sending
- Group management and assignments
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Drag-and-drop column reordering
- Row selection and bulk operations

### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for duplicate emails
- Runtime error prevention with snackbar notifications
- Proper error boundary implementations

### ✅ UI Improvements
- Grey-styled Import CSV button as requested
- Enhanced loading states
- Better accessibility support

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 🚀 Performance
- Reduced bundle size through better tree-shaking
- Faster re-renders due to memoization
- Optimized state updates and event handling

### 🔧 Maintainability
- Single Responsibility Principle applied to each module
- Easier to locate and fix issues
- Better test coverage possibilities

### 📈 Scalability
- Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- Reusable hooks can be used in other components
- Clear separation makes onboarding new developers easier

### 🐛 Reliability
- Enhanced error handling prevents app crashes
- Better state management reduces race conditions
- Comprehensive PropTypes for type safety

## Usage
The component maintains full backward compatibility. No changes needed to existing imports:

```javascript
import ParticipantsTable from 'sections/apps/project-manager/Poject-page/Enrolment-tab/ParticipantsTable';

// Usage remains the same
<ParticipantsTable index={tabIndex} />
```

## Migration Notes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Props interface unchanged
- Redux store integration maintained
- Event handlers and callbacks work as before

## Future Enhancements
- Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety
- Add unit tests for individual hooks and components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Add more advanced filtering options
- Consider React Query for server state management
